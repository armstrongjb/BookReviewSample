<h2 id="Hobbies_/_Interests">Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>	
	<p>In my spare time I have a few hobbies I really enjoy. 
	<ul> 
	   <li> One of them being <em> writing </em>. I write in a journal daily and I often write poetry.
		Through websites such as <b>GoodReads</b> and <b>TheMighty</b> I have several published articles online.
		Writing helps me stay grounded by reflecting on my life and allowing me to express my creativity. </li> 
	   <li> I find that <em>exercise</em> keep me healthy physically and even mentally. For example,
		After a yoga class my mind always feels at ease. It is wonderful for stress relief and helps
		when I am boggled down with work or school.
