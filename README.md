	       <li><em> Hunger </em> by: Roxane Gay</li>
		<p> I really enjoyed this book and I think that it is important to share. Every single person can relate to something in Roxane's story. She writes this memoir not about herself but about her body and how that affects her life, her career, her friends/family. Not only does she touch base on what society can do to your self-esteem but she focuses on the pressures that most face when it comes to the "Body". Our bodies. I highly recommend this book especially if you've ever struggled with your body image, sexual/domestic assault, if you've fat shamed yourself or anyone else, or simply if you'd like to open up your mind.</p>
